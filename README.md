# storybook-tiny

Monorepo for tiny storybooks.

These storybooks are written using the framework where the components will be
created in.

The storybook runs with [vite][] and provides a hash based router by story and
an area to display the test/ story/ components only.

Nothing fancy.

Current supported (no-) frameworks:

- preact@10
- react@18
- solid-js@1
- svelte@4
- vanjs@1
- vue@3
- webcomponents
