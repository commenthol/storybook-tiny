# storybook-tiny

Monorepo for tiny storybooks.

These storybooks are written using the framework where the components will be
created in.

The storybook provides a hash based router by story and an area to display the test/ story/ components only. 

No frills.

Current supported (no-) frameworks:

- preact@10
- react@18
- solid-js@1
- vanjs@1
- webcomponents
